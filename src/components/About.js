                            Hello! My name is Shinhee, and I am a full-stack software engineer creating modern and responsive design for Mobile apps, and the Web. My interest in web development started back in 2010 when I decided my Xanga page needed to have pretty stars flowing down the front page -- turns out that taught me a lot about HTML & CSS!

                            Fast-forward to today, I have just completed the Software Engineering Immersive Program at General Assembly, and I am proud to say my knowledge of programming goes beyond adding pretty stars to a website. With a detail-oriented approach to solving design and development problems, I focus on adding value to any team that I join. I utilize full-stack software solutions primarily focused on JavaScript, React, Node.Js, Python, Django, and MongoDB to create dynamic, high-quality user-focused solutions that deliver the best experience using the highest quality modern development methodology.
